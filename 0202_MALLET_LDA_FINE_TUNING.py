# ### LOADING MALLET
#
# The MALLET framework is a Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text. MALLET stands for MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit. It was developed by Andrew McCallum along with several people at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The MALLET topic modeling toolkit contains efficient, sampling-based implementations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Pachinko Allocation, and Hierarchical LDA. To use MALLETâ€™s capabilities, we need to download the framework.

# ### LDA TUNING; FINDING THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF TOPICS (SAVE ALL MODELS & COHERENCE SCORES)
#
# Finding the optimal number of topics in a topic model is tough, given that it is like a model hyperparameter that you always have to set before training the model. We can use an iterative approach and build several models with differing numbers of topics and select the one that has the highest coherence score. To implement this method, we build the following function.

from tqdm import tqdm
def topic_model_coherence_generator(corpus, texts, dictionary,
                          start_topic_count=2, end_topic_count=10, step=1,
                                    cpus=1):
    models = []
    coherence_scores = []
    for topic_nums in tqdm(range(start_topic_count, end_topic_count+1, step)):
        mallet_lda_model = gensim.models.wrappers.LdaMallet(mallet_path=MALLET_PATH,

                                              id2word=dictionary,
                                              iterations=500, workers=cpus)
        cv_coherence_model_mallet_lda = gensim.models.CoherenceModel(model=mallet_lda_model,
                                                    corpus=corpus,
                                                    texts=texts,
