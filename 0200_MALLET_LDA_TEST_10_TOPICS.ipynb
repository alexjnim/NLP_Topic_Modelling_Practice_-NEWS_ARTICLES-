MALLET stands for MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit. It was developed by Andrew McCallum along with several people at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The MALLET topic modeling toolkit contains efficient, sampling-based implementations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Pachinko Allocation, and Hierarchical LDA.
